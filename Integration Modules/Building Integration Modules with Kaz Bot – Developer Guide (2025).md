# üõ†Ô∏è Building Integration Modules with Kaz Bot ‚Äì Developer Guide (2025)

Kaz Bot‚Äôs modular architecture empowers developers to rapidly create, test, and deploy new integrations‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre connecting to Microsoft 365 APIs, third-party services, or internal tools. This guide provides a clear process and best practices for building integration modules with maximum maintainability and developer agility.

---

## Why Use the Modular Approach?

* **Isolation:** Each module lives in its own folder under `/services/<module>`, ensuring clear separation of logic, configuration, and documentation.
* **Scalability:** Add, update, or remove modules independently‚Äîno impact on the core bot or other integrations.
* **Hot Reload:** Modules can be updated and reloaded instantly, supporting continuous integration and rapid prototyping.
* **Security:** Separate `.env` files per module allow fine-grained control over secrets and API keys.
* **Documentation:** Each module includes its own `info.md`‚Äîkeeping end-user and developer help close to the code.
* **Open Source & Team-Friendly:** This architecture enables parallel development and easy contribution reviews.

## üß© Standard Integration Module Structure

Every module should follow this structure:

```
/services/<module>/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js             # Entrypoint ‚Äì commands, handlers, registration
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ info.md             # Module documentation and usage
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.js           # Module-specific configuration logic
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                # (Optional) Module-scoped secrets, keys, endpoints
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands.js         # (Optional) List and implement custom bot commands
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api.js              # (Optional) REST/Graph API logic, external calls
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ moduleStructure.js  # (Optional) Validates required files for this module
```

## üìù The Role of `main.js`

* **Entry Point:**
  All module logic begins in `main.js`. Here you define:

  * Which commands are registered with the bot.
  * How those commands are handled (handlers, middleware, callbacks).
  * Any setup or teardown logic (`init`, `close`, `reload`, etc.).
* **Registration:**
  The bot automatically loads each `main.js` in `/services/*` at runtime, wiring up commands and endpoints.
* **Loose Coupling:**
  `main.js` can import helpers from other files in its folder (e.g., `api.js`, `commands.js`), keeping logic modular and easy to test.
* **Lifecycle Hooks:**
  Implement `init`, `close`, `reload`, and status-checking for advanced lifecycle control.

---

## üå°Ô∏è Hot Reload & Instant Testing

* **No Restart Needed:**
  Any changes to your module (`main.js`, `commands.js`, etc.) are detected instantly‚Äîno need to restart the main bot.
* **Faster Prototyping:**
  Try new logic, debug, and roll out fixes in seconds.
* **Safe Updates:**
  Faulty or incomplete modules only affect themselves; the bot will continue to run and alert you to specific errors.
* **Best Practice:**
  Make small, incremental changes and test commands via the bot‚Äôs interface‚Äîhot reload gives you immediate feedback.

## üîê Module-Level `.env` Files (Security & Flexibility)

* **Why Separate `.env`?**
  Each module may require unique secrets, API keys, or endpoints (e.g., different Azure tenants, API providers).
  Keeping these settings in a module-specific `.env` avoids leaking secrets between modules and reduces blast radius for security issues.
* **How To Use:**
  Place a `.env` in your module folder (e.g., `/services/entra/.env`), and load it in `config.js` or at module init.
* **Best Practices:**

  * Never commit `.env` files with real secrets to version control‚Äîalways use `.env.example`.
  * Use clear, descriptive variable names (`ENTRA_CLIENT_ID`, `PURVIEW_API_KEY`, etc.).
  * Support fallback to the global `.env` for defaults if module-scoped values are not set.

## ‚ö° Step-by-Step: Creating a New Module

1. **Create the Folder:**

   * `mkdir /services/myIntegration`

2. **Add Required Files:**

   * `main.js` ‚Äî Entry point and command logic.
   * `info.md` ‚Äî Module help, usage, and troubleshooting.
   * (Optional) `config.js`, `.env`, `commands.js`, `api.js` as needed.

3. **Implement Commands in `main.js`:**

   * Define and export your custom commands.
   * Use lifecycle hooks (`init`, `reload`, etc.) for setup or resource management.
   * Leverage utilities from `/utils` for analytics, session management, and exports.

4. **Configure Secrets:**

   * Place sensitive info in `.env` in your module.
   * Reference these in `config.js` for secure loading.

5. **Document Everything:**

   * Fill out `info.md` with usage examples, prerequisites, and troubleshooting tips.

6. **Test and Iterate:**

   * Use bot commands like `!kazbot reload myIntegration` or test commands via chat.
   * Monitor analytics with `!kazbot show session analytics`.

7. **Hot Reload for Updates:**

   * Edit and save your code; changes are applied immediately.
   * Use status/lifecycle commands to confirm or debug.

## ‚úÖ Advantages for Developers

* **Rapid iteration:** Try new APIs, business logic, or compliance checks and see results instantly.
* **Parallel development:** Teams can build and test modules without blocking each other.
* **Easier onboarding:** New contributors only need to understand module APIs‚Äînot the whole bot.
* **Lower risk:** Module crashes don‚Äôt bring down the whole bot. Warnings and logs are module-specific.
* **Compliance ready:** Exports, memory, and audit logs can be module scoped for business/legal requirements.

---

## üöÄ Pro Tips

* Use `moduleStructure.js` to enforce required files for every new integration.
* Extend the bot‚Äôs command list in `commands.js` for user-friendly or advanced operations.
* Keep API logic (`api.js`) separate from command handlers for clean code.
* Use module analytics for feature usage stats and troubleshooting.
* Always provide clear help and troubleshooting in `info.md` for end users and admins.

## üîç Advanced Module Patterns: `mainModuleTopic.js` & `moduleStructure.js`

### `mainModuleTopic.js` ‚Äî Topic Intelligence for LLM & API Context

* **Purpose:**
  This file enables each integration module to define and manage its own topics‚Äîkey for LLM-powered bots and API connectors that benefit from topic-aware memory, prompts, and context filtering.

* **Advantages:**

  * **LLM Optimization:**
    By structuring how topics are created, retrieved, and referenced within a module, you can ensure LLM responses are always contextually relevant and leverage the most appropriate memory and prompts.
  * **Scoped API Interactions:**
    APIs that require context switching (e.g., user profiles, tickets, workflows) can map bot ‚Äútopics‚Äù to external resources, making it easy to maintain state across commands.
  * **Separation of Concerns:**
    Keeps topic logic modular‚Äîchanges in how topics are handled in one module won‚Äôt impact others.
  * **Easy Testing:**
    Developers can adjust topic logic in isolation, enabling rapid experiments on LLM prompt engineering or context windows.

* **Best Practice:**
  Always provide a `mainModuleTopic.js` in your module to define how topics are created, updated, listed, or linked to API entities.
  Expose helper functions to main command handlers (in `main.js`) and document expected topic patterns in `info.md`.

---

### `moduleStructure.js` ‚Äî Enforcing Module Consistency

* **Purpose:**
  This file formally lists the expected files and dependencies for every module (e.g., `main.js`, `info.md`, `config.js`, `commands.js`, `api.js`, `mainModuleTopic.js`, `.env`). It serves both as **documentation** and as a **runtime validator**.

* **Advantages:**

  * **Predictable Structure:**
    Maintains uniformity across all integrations, so developers and automation tools know what to expect.
  * **Automated Checks:**
    The bot can check for missing files at startup or module load, warning developers or blocking incomplete modules from running.
  * **Better Onboarding:**
    New contributors see immediately what files are required, optional, or recommended.
  * **Safer Refactoring:**
    Changes to module patterns are easier to enforce and propagate across all services.

* **Best Practice:**
  Every module should include `moduleStructure.js` and update it as the module evolves.
  Use this file for both automated file presence checks and as living documentation for required/optional pieces.
