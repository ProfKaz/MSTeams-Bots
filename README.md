# ðŸ¤– Welcome to Kaz Bot - A BAAT Project (Bot as a Template)

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

This repository is the result of countless hours exploring, refining, debugging, and yesâ€”chatting with ChatGPTâ€”to bring to life something more than just another bot. What you're seeing here is what I like to call a **BAAT**: *Bot as a Template*.

ðŸ¦‡ **Fun fact**: While building this bot, I kept thinking of how similar "BAAT" sounds to "bat"â€”so if you're picturing a helpful little tech-savvy bat flying through Microsoft Teams, debugging memory issues at night... you're not alone. ðŸ¦‡ðŸ’»

## ðŸ’¡ What is Kaz Bot?

Kaz Bot is a modular, customizable bot template that:

* Connects with Microsoft Teams (or runs locally with Emulator)
* Integrates with Azure OpenAI for ChatGPT-powered responses
* Stores session memory in Azure Blob Storage
* Routes commands like `help`, `reset memory`, and more
* Is ready for Teams OAuth, memory exports, and future middleware logic

Whether you're a beginner exploring bot development or an enterprise engineer looking for a structured baselineâ€”Kaz Bot gives you a strong, extensible starting point.

## ðŸš€ Why This Project?

I'm genuinely excited to launch this initiative and give something back to the community. I believe in building tools that are not just functional, but teachable.

I hope this project:

* Helps others get started with Microsoft Bot Framework
* Serves as a learning hub for secure, scalable bot design
* Evolves with community feedback and contributions

Stay curious, experiment freely, and letâ€™s build something awesome together. ðŸ’¬

Happy coding!
